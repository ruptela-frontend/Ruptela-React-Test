        <p>Hello,</p>
        <p>
          Welcome to the Ruptela React Test. This test is designed to test your
          basic React, Redux and working with REST API skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          For your convenience this, App was bootstrapped using "Create React
          App", "Bulma" and "Redux". It also comes preinstalled with "React
          Router" and "Axios", but you can use library of your choice of HTTP
          client.
        </p>
        <p>
          This component is connected to redux. To test redux setup{' '}
          <button onClick={test}>click here</button>. You should see the message
          change here: {testText}.
        </p>
        <p>
          This React app imitates a website with articles or posts. On the left
          you have a menu to navigate between this page ("Home"), page that
          lists all the post ("Posts"), and the page that adds posts ("Add
          posts").
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, to complete this test you will require an API. You can start the
          API by running <code>yarn api</code> or <code>npm run api</code>. To
          use the api you will make a <code>GET</code> request to{' '}
          <code>http://localhost:3050/posts</code> to get all the posts and a{' '}
          <code>POST</code> request to the same URL to create a new post.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although this website looks pretty, you don't have to pay attention to
          styling, and only focus on the acceptance criteria described below. So
          please don't use any UI libraries like "react-material".
